1. Write out a generic SELECT statement.
SELECT col_name
FROM   table_name
WHERE  clause;

2. Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.
COlUMNS hold up the TABLE WHERE you select your fate.
Column names first, then the table name, then a where clause.

3. Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

a. Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.
SELECT name, gender, age
FROM   dogs
WHERE  breed LIKE '%labrador%';

b. Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.
SELECT id
FROM   dogs
WHERE  age < 1;

c. Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.
SELECT name, age
FROM   dogs
WHERE  gender = F AND weight > 35;

d. Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.
SELECT *
FROM   dogs
WHERE  breed NOT LIKE '%shepherd%';

e. Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.
(Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words. For example, "Labrador Collie mix")
SELECT id, age, weight, breed
FROM   dogs
WHERE  breed LIKE '%great dane%' OR weight > 60;

4. Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?
a. SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;
b. SELECT name, age FROM cats;

5. From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.
a. Display all the information about all of the available cats.
SELECT *
FROM cats;

b. Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.
SELECT name, gender
FROM   cats
WHERE  age > 7;

c. Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.
SELECT name
FROM   cats;

6. List each comparison operator and explain, in your own words, when you would use it. Include a real world example for each. If you can’t list these from memory, do these flashcards until you can!

Comparison Operators
< Less Than - used to compare to values. Topo's in my fridge < 10
> Greater Than - used to compare two values. My age > 35
<= Less than equal to - used to compare two values.
>= Greater than equal to - used to compare two values.
= equal to - used to compare two values or strings. 'Natalie' = 'Natalie'
!= Not equal to used to compare two values or strings. 'Natalie' != 'Michael'
<> Greater than or less than - used to compare two values. Essentially the same as not equal to.
BETWEEN - used to find a value between two others. Find all movies start times between 5:45 and 7:30 pm.

Logic Operators
AND Both statements must be true for the row to be returned.
OR Either statement can be true and the row will be returned.
NOT Not gonna happen, nope. The expression must be false for the row to be returned.
LIKE Used to pattern match.

7. From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?
a. SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = ‘F’;
The names of the female cats.

b. SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;
The names of the cats that are not 3 years old.

c. SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != ‘Mushi’ AND gender = ‘M’;
The ids of all the cats that are not a male cat named Mushi.
